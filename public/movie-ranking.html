<h1>The Best Anime According To Nandini</h1>
<h2>My top animes of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>ONE PIECE</h3>
<p>WAS LENGTHY BUT EXTREMELY AWESOME,DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.</p>
<h3>NARUTO</h3>
<p>
  WAS GOOD TILL THE WAR THEN SUDDENLY THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS GETTING ALL THE
  POWER UPS,SMH.ALSO THE SOB STORY GOT OLD LIKE REAL QUICK , OVERALL WAS GOOD
  BUT COULD HAVE BENN BETTER.
</p>
<h3>JUJUTSU KAISEN</h3>
<p>
  AMAZING JUST SIMPLY AMAZING WISH SOME CHARACTERS WERE STILL ALIVE BUT OVERALL
  IT IS GOOD. THAT IS JUST HOW A STORY IS MADE IF CHARACTERS DID NOT DIE THEN
  THERE WILL BE NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND NO WAY TO DISPLAY THE NAKED
  DESPERATION OF A CHARACTER GOING THROUGH GRIEF AND SHOCK.
</p>
<h4>
  THERE ARE SOME OTHER ANIME TOO LIKE ALL OF THE STUDIO GHIBLI MADE AND SOME
  REINCARNATION TYPES THAT I LIKED LIKE MUSHOKU TENSEI AND THE ACCIDENTLY
  GETTING REBORN AS A VILLANESS ETC., I'VE WATCHED SO MANY ANIMES THAT KEEPING
  TRACK OF THEM ALL IS HARD.
